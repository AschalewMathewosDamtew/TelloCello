# Mobile Network Data Analysis

This project analyzes mobile network performance based on various handset types, focusing on **Average Throughput** and **TCP Retransmission Volume**.

## Data
The dataset includes:
- **Handset Type**: Device model
- **Avg Bearer TP DL (kbps)**: Average downlink throughput
- **TCP DL Retrans. Vol (Bytes)**: TCP downlink retransmission volume

## Tasks
### Task 3.2: Top, Bottom, and Most Frequent Values
- **Top 10/Bottom 10**: Handsets with highest/lowest throughput and retransmissions.
- **Most Frequent**: Handsets with the most recurring values for these metrics.

### Task 3.3: Visualizing Throughput & Retransmission
- **Average Throughput per Handset**: Bar plots for visualizing performance.
- **TCP Retransmission per Handset**: Bar plots to highlight retransmission issues.

Plots are limited to the top 20 handsets for readability.
